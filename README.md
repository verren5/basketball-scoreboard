# Basketball Scoreboard

## Introduction

This project was created for educational purposes and to support a sport event organized by the Indonesian community in Munich. The contributors to this project are also its primary users. The scoreboard is designed to assist the committee in tracking and managing the scores during basketball matches. In addition to providing basic scoreboard functionalities, the project includes an option to export the match results into an Excel file, making it easy to document and share the results.

We are using Glitch to deploy the scoreboard, so the repository submitted to Glitch requires updating the WebSocket URL in `display.js` and `control.js` from 'ws:' to 'wss:'. For local deployment, 'ws:' should be used.
